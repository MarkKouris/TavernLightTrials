The following LUA code:

local function releaseStorage(player)
	player:setStorageValue(1000, -1)
	end

function onLogout(player)
	if player:getStorageValue(1000) == 1 then
		addEvent(releaseStorage, 1000, player)
	end
	return true
end

Can be fixed or improved as followed:

1) verify that player is a valid object before performing operations on it
2) the comparison value in releaseStorage is set to -1, but we check for 1 in onLogout. 

Here are the improvements implemented to the code:

local function releaseStorage(player)
	if not player then
        return false  -- Ensure a valid player object
    else player:setStorageValue(1000,-1)
	end

function onLogout(player)
	if not player then
		return false	-- Ensure player obj is valid
	end
	
	if player:getStorageValue(1000) == -1 then --fixed comparison
		addEvent(releaseStorage, 100, player)
	end
	return true
end
