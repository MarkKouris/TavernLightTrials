# TavernLightTrials

This repository contains my answers to the coding trial given to me by Tavernlight Games. 
The 7 problems are broken up into 7 different folders.
For the 4 simple code fixing problems, I will include it all in a single text document.
For the 3 Coding problems, I will include given recordings, my own source code, a recording of my finished product, and a readme to explain my thought process.
