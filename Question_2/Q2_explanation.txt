The following LUA code:

function printSmallGuildNames(memberCount)
	-- this method is supposed to print names of all guilds that have less than memberCount max members
	local selectGuildQuery = "SELECT name FROM guilds WHERE max_members < %d;"
	local resultId = db.storeQuery(string.format(selectGuildQuery, memberCount))
	local guildName = result.getString("name")
	print(guildName)
end

Can be improved as follows:

1) handling data base results properly
2) There is no error handling for if the database query fails or returns an empty results set. 
3) the string format is a potential sql vulnerability. 

I would implement the code as such:

function printSmallGuildNames(memberCount)
	--print names of all guilds that have less than memberCount max members
	local selectGuildQuery = "SELECT name FROM guilds WHERE max_members < %d;"
	local resultId = db.storeQuery(selectGuildQuery, memberCount)
	
	if not resultId then
		print("Failed to execute database query")
		return
	end

	local guildNames = {} --table to store guild names
	
	repeat
		local row = resultId.getNext()
		if row then
			local guildName = row:getString("name")
			table.insert(guildNames, guildName)
		end
	until not row
	
	resultId:free()
	
	--print all guild names
	for _, name in ipairs(guildNames) do
		print(name)
	end
end

My changes include:
- replaced the direct string interpolation with a parameterized query to mitigate SQL injection vulnerabilities
- added error handling to check if the query execution fails or returns an empty result set. 
- added proper iteration
- introduced the table 'guildNames' to store the fetched guild names before printing them out.
